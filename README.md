# Traffic Sign Classifier

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to recognize and classify traffic signs from images. Utilizing the Traffic Sign dataset, the project implements image preprocessing, feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and EfficientNetB0, and comprehensive model training.

Key components of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and class label encoding.

Model Training: Training a CNN and EfficientNetB0 over 20 epochs with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Evaluation Metrics: Achieved an accuracy of 79.26%, precision of 83.37%, recall of 79.26%, and an F1 score of 79.48%.

Visualizations: Includes evaluation metrics bar plots and a confusion matrix for detailed classification performance.

Future work may involve experimenting with different architectures, improving real-time recognition capabilities, and expanding the dataset for enhanced model robustness.
